# Lecture 1 - The Motivation & Applications of Machine Learning   
Arthur Samuel. ML definition. Play checkers.        
Tom Mitchell. Well-posed learning problem. experience E, task T, performance measure P.     
Four major parts:   
1.Supervised learning. supervising the algorithm; give the algorithm the quote right answer for a number of houses, then find the association with input and output with right answers.      
Classification problems. based on one or two or several inputs.     
2. Learning theory. more data or improve algorithm.       
3. Unsupervised learning. No right answer for the data.      
4. Reinforcement learning. 加固，加强；援军. reward function. specify what you want done. maximize "good dog", minimize "bad dog".
